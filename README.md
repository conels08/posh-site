📁 POSH Salon & Spa — Official Website

Modern, responsive, client-ready website built for a real business in Newberg, Oregon.

Live Site: https://poshnewberg.com
Tech Stack: HTML • CSS • JavaScript • Netlify • Git
📌 Overview

This project is a fully custom website built from scratch for POSH Salon & Spa, a multi-service beauty studio featuring stylists, estheticians, and a nurse injector. The goal was to create a site that is modern, fast, mobile-friendly, and easy for both clients and staff to interact with.
